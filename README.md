# FinVisor Web App

The FinVisor web app is a financial awareness tool created by Syed Rizvi.
The idea originally started with a group of four programmers at the HackTX 2019
hackathon, after which Syed continued working on the web app version of
the program.

The aim of this app is to make people more aware of their financial standing
by giving users a convinient place to input expenses and income.

This application was made using Python, Flask, HTML, CSS, and SQLAlchemy.

The application is not yet deployed on a server, however I am currently looking into hosting
options. Future plans for improving the app include creating a system of financial advising 
on the app, to give users further guidance and help them make more informed financial decisions.
