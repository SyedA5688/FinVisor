# FinVisor Web App
FinVisor is a financial awareness web app tool created by Syed Rizvi. The idea originally started with a group of four programmers at the HackTX 2019 hackathon, after which Syed continued working on the web app version of
the program.

The aim of this app is to make people more aware of their financial standing by giving users a convenient place to input expenses and income.
